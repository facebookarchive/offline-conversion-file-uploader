# Offline Conversion Automated Uploader
Offline Conversion Automated Uploader is a command line tool that helps Facebook advertisers and marketing partners upload offline transactions to the [Facebook marketing API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/offline-conversions) without building their own application for API Integration.

## Prerequisites
* An offline event set. [How to create](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/339320669734609)
* Your offline event file in CSV format. [Examples](https://github.com/facebookincubator/offline-conversion-file-uploader/blob/master/offline-events/demo-offline-events/test-event-files.zip)
* **Strongly recommended:** manually upload your offline events via [UI](https://business.facebook.com/events_manager/?selected_data_sources=DATA_SET) to familiarize yourself with this product.
* System user access token. [Follow step 4 - 6 of this guide.](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/offline-conversions). Not required if you only use this tool to hash the data.

## How to use

### Install

Make sure git and node are installed and are up-to-date on your machine, then run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/facebookincubator/offline-conversion-file-uploader
npm install
npm run compile
```

### Examples

Before uploading real data, you can create a test data set and upload some test data to familiarize yourself with this tool. Take a look at this [guide](https://github.com/facebookincubator/offline-conversion-file-uploader/blob/master/offline-events/demo-offline-events/demo.md) and have a try.

### Run Command

Use `validate` command when you are setting up the tool and config. Check the report generated by this command and resolve issues. Once you are done with configuration, use `upload` command to upload events.

If you want to separate the hashing and uploading into two steps. You can use `preprocess` command first to hash the file, and then use `upload-preprocessed` command to upload the hashed file.

```
node lib/cli.js <COMMAND> --configFilePath <PATH_TO_CONFIG> <...OTHER_PARAMS>
```

See the **Commands** section for details of each command. See the previous section for some sample commands.

### Schedule

Once you make sure an upload is made successfully, you can automate your upload by scheduling the command. We recommend to use **crontab** for POSIX systems, and use **Powershell** and **Task Scheduler** for Windows.

## Commands
|Command|Description|Options (Required options are in bold)|
|-------|-----------|--------------------------------------|
|upload|Hash and upload the CSV file to Facebook.|**`accessToken`** **`configFilePath`** **`dataSetID`** **`inputFilePath`** **`mapping`** `batchSize` `customTypeInfo`  `delimiter` `format` `header` `ignoreSampleErrors` `logging` `namespaceID` `presetValues` `reportOutputPath` `skipRowsAlreadyUploaded` `uploadID` `uploadTag` `uploadTagPrefix`|
|validate|Do a dry-run and validate some sample rows.|**`accessToken`** **`configFilePath`** **`dataSetID`** **`inputFilePath`** **`mapping`** `customTypeInfo` `delimiter` `format` `header` `logging` `namespaceID` `numRowsToValidate` `presetValues` `reportOutputPath`|
|preprocess|Hash the CSV file and store it locally without sending it Facebook. It also normalizes other fields, such as converting ISO-formatted event time into unix time.|**`inputFilePath`** **`configFilePath`** **`mapping`** `customTypeInfo` `delimiter` `format` `header` `ignoreSampleErrors` `logging` `preprocessOutputPath` `presetValues` `reportOutputPath`|
|upload-preprocessed|Upload the hashed CSV generated by `preprocess` command.|**`accessToken`** **`dataSetID`** **`inputFilePath`** `batchSize` `configFilePath` `ignoreSampleErrors` `logging` `namespaceID` `reportOutputPath` `skipRowsAlreadyUploaded` `uploadID` `uploadTag` `uploadTagPrefix`|

## Options
### How to Specify

Most options can be specified in both ways.

For example, if you want to specify `accessToken`, you can either do it by passing it directly to CLI command

``` bash
node lib/cli.js <COMMAND> --accessToken <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN> ...
```

or by setting it in the config JSON specified by `configFilePath`.

```json
{
    "accessToken": <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>,
    ...
}
```

For boolean options like `skipRowsAlreadyUploaded`, when specifying in CLI, there is no need to explicitly set it to `true`

```bash
node lib/cli.js <COMMAND> --skipRowsAlreadyUploaded ...
```

### All Options

Here is a list of all options we support. See previous section for options supported/required by each command. See **Resuming Support** to see why `uploadTag`/`uploadTagPrefix`/`uploadID` are deprecated.

### Mapping for Offilne Events

The `mapping` field is a dictionary that maps the index of a column to offline event schema. Here is an example:

```json
"mapping": {
  "0": "match_keys.email",
  "1": "match_keys.phone",
  "2": "event_time",
  "3": "event_name",
  "4": "value",
  "5": "currency",
  "7": "custom_data.sales_type",
  "9": "custom_data.department"
}
```

The key of `mapping` is the index of column, starting with 0. The value of mapping field can be one of the values listed in the following table:

| Mapping           | Is Required                                                  | Description                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| match_keys.XXXXX  | Required.                                                    | The identifier info used to match people. XXXXX needs to be replaced with the match key type such as email, phone, etc. For list of available match key types, please see 'Key name' column in [this table](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/offline-conversions#match-keys). |
| event_time        | Required.                                                    | Time when the offline conversion happened. The data in the corresponding column is recommend to be formatted in ISO8601 (example: `2018-03-09T19:17:19.345Z`) or unix time (example: `1520623023`). |
| event_name        | Required. Can be either specified in `mapping` or in `presetValues`. | See `event_name` row in the [data parameters table](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/offline-conversions/#data-parameters). |
| value             | Required if exists event having `Purchase` as `event_name`. Optional for other cases. | Value of conversion event. Required for Purchase event. We do not accept 0 and negative values. Example: `16.00`. |
| currency          | Required if `value` is mapped. Can be either specified in `mapping` of in `presetValues`. | Three-letter ISO currency for this conversion event. Required when and only when value presents. |
| order_id          | Optional but recommended. Required if `item_number` is mapped. | The unique ID associated with each of your transactions.     |
| item_number       | Optional.                                                    | Item number is to distinguish different items within same order. |
| custom_data.XXXXX | Optional.                                                    | Additional information about the conversion event. For example, send store location ID as custom_data.location_id. |

We also provide a `presetValues` option for your convenience if your CSV file does not contain a column for `event_name` or `currency`. For example, if all of your events are purchases and uses USD as currency, you can use the following presetValues:

```json
"presetValues": {
    "event_name": "Purchase",
    "currency": "USD"
}
```

Note that you cannot specify a field's value in both `presetValues` and `mapping`. For example, in the use case above, you are not allowed to map any column to `event_name` or `currency` in your `mapping`, since they are already specified in `presetValues`.

For some specific mapping, namely `match_keys.dob` and `event_time`, you also need to specify the format of your data in the `format` option.

For `match_keys.dob` we support the following format:

- `MM/DD/YYYY` `MMDDYYYY` `MM-DD-YYYY`
- `DD/MM/YYYY` `DDMMYYYY` `DD-MM-YYYY`
- `YYYY/MM/DD` `YYYYMMDD` `YYYY-MM-DD`
- `MM/DD/YY` `MMDDYY` `MM-DD-YY`
- `DD/MM/YY` `DDMMYY` `DD-MM-YY`
- `YY/MM/DD` `YYMMDD` `YY-MM-DD`

And for `event_time` we support `ISO8601` and `unix_time`. We also support formats listed above for `event_time`, but that's not recommended, as we recommend `event_time` accurate to minutes or seconds.

For `event_time`, we provide an additional option to offset the time zone. For `ISO8601` and `unix_time` time zone is not needed, so please set it to 0. For other formats, you can set it to an number that represents offset (in hours) that should be applied to the `event_time`.

Here is an example of `format`, note that the format of `event_time` and `match_keys.dob` differs slightly:

```json
"format": {
  "event_time": {
    "timeFormat": "ISO8601"
  },
  "dob": "MM/DD/YYYY"
}
```

The last piece of mapping is `customTypeInfo`. If you don't map any custom data fields, please leave it unspecified or as an empty dictionary `{}`. If you mapped custom data field, for each custom data field, you need to specify its type to be either `string` or `number` type. For example, if you've mapped `custom_data.margin_value` and `custom_data.department_name`, you need to set `customTypeInfo` to

```json
"customTypeInfo": {
  "margin_value": {
    "baseType": "number"
  },
  "department_name": {
    "baseType": "string"
  }
}
```

### Resuming Support

Resuming is a way to ensure each row is uploaded once and only once, regardless of process or machine crashes, or network failures. Only offline events upload is supported.

The following prerequisites should be satisfied to support resuming:

- You should use different file names for each input file. A way to guarantee that is to add a date stamp at each file. For example, you use `Offline conversions 2018-03-01.csv` to represent sales happen that day (or that week).
- Once the input file is generated, you don't change it.
- The anti-pattern is to use one file name for all events, and you update the file for new events. **Don't do this.**

Then when you call the script to upload the events, make sure:

- Do **not** specify `uploadTag`/`uploadTagPrefix`/`uploadID`. We'll automatically generate an `uploadTag` for you based on the name and size of input file, we use the auto generated `uploadTag` to discover the range of events that were already uploaded.
- Set `skipRowsAlreadyUploaded`. This options will allow the uploader to skip the rows that falls into the ranges uploaded before.
