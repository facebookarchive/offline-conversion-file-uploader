# Custom Audience Upload

## Prerequisites
* Your custom audience file in CSV format. [Examples](https://github.com/facebookincubator/offline-conversion-file-uploader/blob/master/custom-audience/demo-audience/test-audience-files.zip)
* **Strongly recommended:** manually upload your offline events via [UI](https://business.facebook.com//ads/manage/audiences.php) to familiarize yourself with this product.
* System user access token. [Follow step 4 - 6 of this guide.](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/offline-conversions). Not required if you only use this tool to hash the data.

## How to use

### Install

Make sure git and node are installed and are up-to-date on your machine, then run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/facebookincubator/offline-conversion-file-uploader
npm install
npm run compile
```

### Examples

Before uploading real data, you can create a test data set and upload some test data to familiarize yourself with this tool. Take a look at this [guide](https://github.com/facebookincubator/offline-conversion-file-uploader/blob/master/custom-audience/demo-audience/demo.md) and have a try.

### Run Command

```
node lib/cli.js upload-audience --configFilePath <PATH_TO_CONFIG> <...OTHER_PARAMS>
```

See the **Commands** section for details of each command. See the previous section for some sample commands.

### Schedule

Once you make sure an upload is made successfully, you can automate your upload by scheduling the command. We recommend to use **crontab** for POSIX systems, and use **Powershell** and **Task Scheduler** for Windows.

## Commands
|Command|Description|Options (Required options are in bold)|
|-------|-----------|--------------------------------------|
|upload-audience|Add or remove users to/from your custom audience.|**`accessToken`** **`apiVersion`** **`configFilePath`** **`customFileSource`** **`inputFilePath`** **`mapping`** `adAccountID` `appIDs` `batchSize` `customAudienceID` `delimiter` `format` `header` `ignoreSampleErrors` `logging` `pageIDs` `removeUsers` `reportOutputPath`|

## Options
### How to Specify

Most options can be specified in both ways.

For example, if you want to specify `accessToken`, you can either do it by passing it directly to CLI command

``` bash
node lib/cli.js <COMMAND> --accessToken <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN> ...
```

or by setting it in the config JSON specified by `configFilePath`.

```json
{
    "accessToken": <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>,
    ...
}
```

For boolean options like `ignoreSampleErrors`, when specifying in CLI, there is no need to explicitly set it to `true`

```bash
node lib/cli.js <COMMAND> --ignoreSampleErrors ...
```

### All Options

### Mapping for Custom Audience

The `mapping` field is a dictionary that maps the index of a column to custom audience schema. Here is an example:

```json
"mapping": {
  "0": "match_keys.email",
  "1": "match_keys.phone",
  "2": "lookalike_value",
}
```

| Mapping          | Is Required | Description                                                  |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| match_keys.XXXXX  | Required.                                                    | The identifier info used to match people. XXXXX needs to be replaced with the match key type such as email, phone, etc. For list of available match key types, please see 'Key name' column in [this table](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/offline-conversions#match-keys). |
| lookalike_value  | Optional.   | The life-time value of a user. This is for value-based lookalike audience. We do not accept 0 and negative values. |

For `match_keys.dob` we support the following format:

- `MM/DD/YYYY` `MMDDYYYY` `MM-DD-YYYY`
- `DD/MM/YYYY` `DDMMYYYY` `DD-MM-YYYY`
- `YYYY/MM/DD` `YYYYMMDD` `YYYY-MM-DD`
- `MM/DD/YY` `MMDDYY` `MM-DD-YY`
- `DD/MM/YY` `DDMMYY` `DD-MM-YY`
- `YY/MM/DD` `YYMMDD` `YY-MM-DD`

### Note on Resuming

For custom audience upload, you can safely upload duplicated rows of a same user. So, we don't support resuming for custom audience upload.
